# Twitter Stream Echo

I wanted to code several scripts that would consume the Twitter Streaming API to get different stats with live data.

The [Rate Limiting for the streaming API][rate_limits] only allows one connection per IP address and blacklists IPs doing excessive connections:

> Each account may create only one standing connection to the Streaming API.
> Subsequent connections from the same account may cause previously established
> connections to be disconnected. Excessive connection attempts, regardless of
> success, will result in an automatic ban of the client's IP address.
> Continually failing connections will result in your IP address being
> blacklisted from all Twitter access.

I created this small service in order to be able to consume the streaming API from several scripts in my computer with one single connection and being able to restart the scripts without triggering reconnections to Twitter.

This small TCP service establishes one single connection to the Twitter Streaming API and echoes all the tweets to any client connected to the socket at `/tmp/tweets.sock`.

## Usage

1. Download the service: `git clone https://github.com/ernesto-jimenez/node-twitter-stream-echo.git`
2. Edit echo.js and type your twitter username and password.
3. Run the service: `node echo.js`
4. Connect to `/tmp/tweets.js` and have fun :)

You can test the service using telnet: `telnet /tmp/tweets.sock`
